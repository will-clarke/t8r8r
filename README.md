The perfect app to rate your favourite potatoes in.

Featuring:

- [ELO rating algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to work out which potato is **OBJECTIVELY THE BEST**
- An auth system I just imported
- A web app written in Phoenix and Elixir (functional & good at concurrency!)
- Limitless starchy potential
